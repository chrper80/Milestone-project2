                <p>
                    I worked with Neema when I was managing a Contact Centre Solution Project as a service provider for
                    Vodacom Tanzania. She was Manager: Audit & Compliance (Service Quality) and I was the Project
                    Manager for the solution we were deploying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neema is meticulous in her approach to quality in whatever she does. On the aforementioned project,
                    she was consistently working towards improving quality at all levels in here department. Neema went
                    about her job without any complaints and helped structure reports that were in line with the overall
                    company and departmental objectives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her expertise lies in successfully managing teams, processes, and strategic programs to drive
                    continuous quality improvement efforts through audits and special projects. Through my experience
                    working with Neema, I gained wealth of knowledge in data analysis and orchestrating project
                    implementations, as well as ensuring compliance on regulatory and company policies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Neema is a reserved person but thorough in whatever she does. I would recommend her for any Quality
                    Assurance Position in any sector.
