# CV website for Neema Kisanga

## UXD

### Strategy plane

The reason for this website is to show Neemas skills and experiences to potential employers. The target audience are recruiters and hiring managers. The needs of the persons in those roles would be to see her skills, experiences and achievements. They would also be interested in knowing about Neema as a person, if she works better as an individual or in a team, if she is social and her values (for instance that she finds sustainability very important). Neemas needs are to showcase her skills, what she is capable of, who she is and her experience.

### Scope plane

The features that Neema wanted on her page are:
1. An about section with a short summary about values, interests, top skills and what kind of worker she is.
1. A page with the CV on it.
1. A contact page with a contact form.
1. A testimonials page.
1. A map displaying where she lives.
1. Links to her LinkedIn page, phone and email.
1. A page with info on former and current workplaces.
1. A frontpage with an image.

### Structure plane

I went for a hierachical structure because it takes away complexity. We wanted the visitors to get the impression that she is very organized (that is one of her greatest skills), so we wanted her website to be very easy to navigate. I wanted to add states chenges to give the user feedback that something is going to happen or that something has happened as a result of their actions. I also wanted clear feedback so they know if there is an error or if they succeeded.

### Skeleton plane

I wanted to add a clear and easy navigation and i wanted it to be on top. I also wanted a button to get back to top quick and easy, even though there is not so much info on the pages, so it would not take so much time to scroll. The hamburger icon is a well known symbol for a hidden menu and it´s very convenient to use on mobile if there are more then a few menu items, so i decided to use it on mobile. When it comes to the order of the menu items, it felt natural to have the about page after the home page and to end with the contact page.

### Surface plane

Neema wanted the font Gill Sans because she wanted to give the impression of being professional and friendly. We agreed on using a deep, dark green because it´s very calming. I decided on using red for the hovering effect over the menu items because it gives a good contrast and the colors go well together. It´s also important from a accessibility point of view with high contrast. An example is for people with impaired eyesight. Clear contrast makes it easier for them to read. But also for people with perfect sight, it feels better to read when there is a clear separation between background and foreground.
